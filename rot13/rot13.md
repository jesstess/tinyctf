Unzipping the challenge file produces a short text file containing:

This is probably a substitution cipher. We could write code to solve
it, or just use an [online solver](http://quipqiup.com/index.php):

```
BROKEN MEN ARE MORE DESERVING OF OUR PITY, THOUGH THEY MAY BE JUST AS
DANGEROUS. ALMOST ALL ARE COMMON-BORN, SIMPLE FOLK WHO HAD NEVER BEEN
MORE THAN A MILE FROM THE HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE BORN UNTIL THE DAY
SOME LORD CAME ROUND TO TAKE THEM OFF TO WAR. YOUR FLAG IS "NO THIS IS
NOT CRYPTO MY DEAR", IN LOWERCASE, WITH UNDERSCORES INSTEAD OF
SPACES, SURROUNDED BY THE USUAL "FLAG" TAG AND CURLY BRACES. ENJOY.
```

Following the instructions in the decrypted cipher, the flag is
**no_this_is_not_crypto_my_dear**.
